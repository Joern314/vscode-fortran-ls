## Requirements
This package requires the following extensions to be installed:
 * [Modern Fortran](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=krvajalm.linter-gfortran) or [fortran](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gimly81.fortran)

Additionally, you must have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the
[Fortran Language Server](https://github.com/hansec/fortran-language-server) installed
on your system. Be sure to periodically update the underlying language server to stay up to date with
new features and fixes.

This package has been tested and *should* work on :apple: macOS (OS X), :penguin: Linux and Windows.

## Configuration

**Note:** When setting an explicit language server executable path on Windows backslashes must be escaped (ex. `C:\\path\\to\\fortls.exe`).

Due to Fortran's syntax it is recommended that you disable the `Enter` key for suggestion confirmation.
This can be done selectively in fortran files by adding the snippet below to your
[settings.json file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings).

    "[fortran]": {
        "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off"
    },
    "[FortranFixedForm]": {
        "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off"
    },
    "[FortranFreeForm]": {
        "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off"
    }

See the [fortran-language-server README](https://github.com/hansec/fortran-language-server/blob/master/README.rst) for
information on project specific configuration settings.
